# Assignment 1: Time conversion

## Part 1

Write program code to:

1. ask the user to input the number of seconds,
2. convert seconds to minutes and seconds (as integers),
3. print the number of minutes and seconds.

*Hint: You can use `divmod()` to get the number of minutes and seconds in the same step.*

### Expected output

    Enter the number of seconds (integer): 48
    The duration is 0 minutes and 48 seconds.
    Enter the number of seconds (integer): 72
    The duration is 1 minutes and 12 seconds.

## Part 2

Extend the above program code to:

1. ask the user to input the number of **seconds**,
2. convert seconds to hours, minutes, and seconds (as integers),
3. print the number of **hours, minutes, and seconds**.

# Submission
